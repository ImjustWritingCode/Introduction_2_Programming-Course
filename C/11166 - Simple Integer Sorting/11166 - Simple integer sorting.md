## 11166 - Simple integer sorting

### Description

Given some integers, please list them in increasing order.

### Input

First line is an integer T (T <= 20) followed by T test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines. First line is an integer n (n <= 10^4), and second line contains n integers V1, V2, ..., Vn. (-2^31< Vi < 2^31-1 for 1 <= i <= n )

### Output

For each test case, list a line of numbers from the smallest one to the largest one ending with '\n'. Two adjacent numbers in one line should be separated by a whitespace.
