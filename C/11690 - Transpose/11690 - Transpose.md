jjjjj doesn't like long description.

Given an ***m*** ✕ ***n*** matrix ***A***, please calculate the [transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose) of ***A***.

Note: The is a partial judge problem. We have already handled the input and output for you. All you have to do is to implement the function "Transpose".

### Input

The first line contains two integers ***m***, ***n***, representing the dimension of ***A***.

The next m lines contain n integers ***aij***, representing the indices of ***A***.

It is guaranteed that :

- **1 ≤ m, n ≤ 500**

We have already handled the input for you.

### Output

Please output the transpose of ***A***.

We have already handled the output for you.
