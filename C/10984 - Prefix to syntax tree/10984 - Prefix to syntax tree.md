You will be provided with main.c and function.h, and asked to implement function.c.

For OJ submission:

​        Step 1. Submit only your function.c into the submission block.(Please choose C compiler)

​        Step 2. Check the results and debug your program if necessary.

### Input

The first line will have a number N with the number of test cases, followed by N lines of input, each contain the prefix Boolean expression.

### Output

There are N lines infix expression with necessary parenthesis.



###Reminder: This is a partial judge header. Which means only "function.c" is designed by myself. Special thanks to TAs of the class!
