Given several sentences, please modify the sentences so that the order of the words is reversed.

### Input

There are **multiple lines** in each test case.

Each line contains a sentence with several words, or there may be no word within it.

Each word will be separated by one or several whitespace.

Also, whitespaces may appear in the front or in the back of the sentence.

It is guaranteed that:

- **At most 10 lines in each test case.**
- **Each line contains at most 100 characters.**
- **Contains only lowercase letter in each word.**

### Output

For each sentence, please output the modified sentence with the reverse sequence of words.

Attention: 

(1) After modification, each word is separated by only one whitespace.

(2) If there is no word in the sentence, you still need to output '\n'.
