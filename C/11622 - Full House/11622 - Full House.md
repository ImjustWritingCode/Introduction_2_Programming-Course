## 11622 - Full House

### Description

The "Mannulus" casino is now celebrating its grand opening in Canterlot! The owner, Lightyear, introduces the cutting-edge technology to the casino : Farseer Cards Auto Detect System. If it works well, the casino will no longer need to employ any dealer!

The question is : the system cannot automatically rank the cards in the correct order. So Lightyear decides to hire a group of programmers to improve the whole system. You, as a beginning programmer, is assigned to write a program to check whether a set of **five** cards forms a **full house** or not. Lightyear will then give you **T** sets of cards to verify the correctness of your program.

### Input

The first line contains an integer **T**, representing the number of sets Lightyear gives to you.

The next T lines contain 5 cards in each given set, separated by whitespaces**.**

The cards would range from : {A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10, J, Q, K}.

(In this problem, you don't need to consider the suit of each card.)

- **1 ≤ | T | ≤ 10000**

### Output

For each set of card, please print '**YES**' if the set is a full house, otherwise please print '**NO**'.

Remember to print **'\n'** after each answer.
