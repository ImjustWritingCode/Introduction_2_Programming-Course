Given **n** numbers, you need to find a number **k** such that **SUM** is minimum,

where we define **SUM** ***= ( a1 ^ k ) + ( a2 ^ k ) + ... + ( an ^ k )***

(^ stands for the "xor" [bitwise operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) of the two operand)

### Input

The first line contains an integer **n**, representing the number of numbers.

The next line contains n integers **ai**, representing each given number.

It is guaranteed that:

- **n** **≤ 10^5**
- **0 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6**
- **All numbers ( ai and k ) are unsigned numbers**

### Output

Please output the value of **SUM.**

Note **SUM** may exceed **INT**.
