## 11055 - Vector Intersection

### Description

**Given two vectors of numbers, output their intersection set.**

**Note: the numbers of vectors need not to be unique.**

### Input

There are multiple test cases. Each case contains four lines. The first line begins with an integer N. The second line contains N integers, representing the numbers in the first set. The third line has one integer M, and the fourth line contains M integers, represent the numbers in the second set. **All the numbers are 32 bit signed integers**. The input is terminated if N = 0.

For case 1, 1 <= N, M <= 10^3
For case 2, 1 <= N, M <= 10^4
For case 3, 1 <= N, M <= 10^5
For case 4, 1 <= N, M <= 10^6

### Output

For each test case, print the intersection of the two sets. Output them in ascending order. If the intersection of the two sets is an empty set, print “empty” (without quotes).

 

Note: There's a newline character at the end of each output.
